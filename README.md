### Installation

#### iOS

**Note** Please make sure to have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) on your computer.
1. In you terminal, change into your `ios` directory.

2. Create a pod file by running: `pod init`.

3. Add the following to your pod file:

```
    platform :ios, '8.0'

    target '<YourProjectName>' do
  		node_modules_path = '../node_modules'

  		pod 'yoga', path: "#{node_modules_path}/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga.podspec"
  		pod 'React', path: "#{node_modules_path}/react-native", :subspecs => ['DevSupport', 'RCTNetwork']

  		pod 'RNStringee', path: "#{node_modules_path}/stringee-react-native/ios"
    end

    post_install do |installer|
      installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name == "React"
          target.remove_from_project
        end
      end
    end

```

4. Now run, `pod install`

5. Open XCode

6. Open `<YourProjectName>.xcworkspace` file in XCode. This file can be found in the `ios` folder of your React Native project.
